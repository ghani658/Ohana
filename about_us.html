                                <strong>To dine at Ohana reservations are required. At this time, we will not be
                                    accepting walk-ins.</strong></br>
                                We ask that you not enter the building any earlier than 10 minutes prior to your
                                reservation. </br>
                                Our single party table capacity will be limited to a total of 8 people maximum. All
                                children/babies count as people and count toward your party size. For mixed reservation,
                                meaning multiple parties, the table will be limited to 6 people total and will be spaced
                                out or seated on opposite ends of our grills. Again, all people are counted toward your
                                party size, this includes children/babies.</br> Because of our business limitations, we
                                ask that you please notify us if your plans change and you won’t be dining with us.
                                Since we are only doing reservations, without prior knowledge we lose on potential
                                customers we could have given those seats to.
                            </p>

                                            flying shrimp, the chefs of Ohana Steakhouse will serve up one of the most
                                            entertaining dinners in Des Moines.
                                        </p>

                                            Ohana features teppanyaki style dining, a Japanese term meaning: teppan-griddle,
                                            and yaki-fry or cook. The translation is quite literal as all guests' dinners
                                            are cooked right in front of them on a grill built into the table set for ten.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Dinner begins with Japanese clear soup and a salad with a delicious Italian
                                            cream or ginger dressing. Things get lively when your table's chef appears.
                                            Regulars often request their favorite chef, but they are all very talented says
                                            Owner Cy Gushiken, who is a chef himself. Cy & Tami Gushiken have been the
                                            owners since 1996. Cy is from Hilo, Hawaii; currently lives 15 minutes west of
                                            Des Moines & has been here for over 20 years.

                                            After the soup and salad the chef gets busy on the table-grill with the
                                            teppanyaki shrimp appetizers, mixed vegetables and fried rice. Here come the
                                            "don't try this at home" tricks as your choice from a diverse selection of
                                            entrees is cooked to order at the table. Top dinner off with a choice selection
